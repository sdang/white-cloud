				<h4 class="alert-heading">Group Passwords Secure Health Information</h4>
				OV Tools contains a significant amount of protected health information (PHI). In order to maximally
				protect PHI, it is encrypted on multiple levels using the group password as a key. Only users
				with a login and the group password are able to view PHI.<br/>
				<br/>
				In order to obtain the group password, please contact the department of medicine. Without the
				group password you will be able to create d/c summaries and signouts, however you will not be
				able to retrieve this information.
